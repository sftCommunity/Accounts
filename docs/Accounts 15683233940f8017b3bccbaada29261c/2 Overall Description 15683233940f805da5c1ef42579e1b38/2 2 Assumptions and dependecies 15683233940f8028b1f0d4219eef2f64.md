# 2.2 Assumptions and dependecies

### **Assumptions**

1. **Manual Data Entry for MVP**
    - It is assumed that users will manually input their account details, payments, debts, and bills for the MVP. Automation features, such as bank syncing, will be introduced in later stages.
2. **Internet Connectivity Requirement**
    - It is assumed that users will have reliable internet access for interacting with the application, as it is a cloud-based solution and requires online access for synchronization and updates.
3. **User Knowledge of Financial Terms**
    - It is assumed that the target audience has a basic understanding of financial concepts such as accounts, payments, bills, and debts. The platform will avoid complex financial jargon and aim for a user-friendly interface.
4. **Minimal Cross-Platform Compatibility for MVP**
    - The MVP will focus on web accessibility, with mobile responsiveness as a secondary priority. Native mobile apps may be considered in later versions.
5. **Security Assumptions**
    - It is assumed that users' personal and financial data will be protected through modern encryption techniques (e.g., SSL/TLS) and secure authentication (e.g., JWT). No major breaches are anticipated during the MVP phase, though further security measures will be implemented in the future.
6. **User Engagement for Notifications**
    - It is assumed that users will opt into receiving email reminders for due bills and debts. This feature will be critical to ensuring user retention during the MVP phase.
7. **Initial Focus on Personal Finance**
    - The platform will initially target individual users managing personal finances, not businesses or organizations. The scope of multi-user or collaborative features is excluded from the MVP.
8. **Limited Features for MVP**
    - It is assumed that the MVP will focus only on core functionalities (e.g., account management, payment tracking, bill management), with more advanced features like automated bank syncing or advanced reporting to be added in future iterations.

### **Dependencies**

1. **Cloud Infrastructure and Hosting**
    - The project will depend on cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for hosting the backend and storing user data securely. Any limitations or outages from the cloud service provider could impact performance or availability.
2. **Database Services**
    - The application will rely on a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for storing user data. Any issues with the database provider, scaling limitations, or latency could affect application performance.
3. **Authentication Services**
    - The project will depend on third-party libraries (e.g., Passport.js, JWT) for secure user authentication. Any changes to these libraries or integration issues could delay progress.
4. **Email Service Providers for Notifications**
    - Email reminders will rely on third-party email service providers (e.g., SendGrid, Amazon SES). Service interruptions or limitations in the provider’s free tier may affect notification delivery.
5. **Payment Gateway Integration (Future Feature)**
    - In later stages, integrating payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for automated bill payments may depend on external API documentation, compliance, and integration complexity.
6. **Third-Party APIs for Bank Synchronization (Future Feature)**
    - If bank syncing features are introduced in the future, the application will depend on APIs from financial data aggregators like **Plaid** or **Yodlee** to access bank transaction data. This will require user consent and integration with third-party services.
7. **Regulatory Compliance (Future Feature)**
    - As financial data is highly sensitive, future features of the application will need to comply with regulations like **GDPR**, **PCI DSS** for payment processing, or **CCPA** for user privacy. Any changes to these regulations will need to be incorporated into the platform.
8. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
    - The platform will depend on modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for consistent rendering. Compatibility issues with specific browsers could require additional development.

### **Summary of Assumptions and Dependencies**

The **Accounts** project’s development relies on a few key assumptions, including the manual entry of financial data in the MVP, internet access, and basic financial literacy. The MVP will focus on web accessibility, with mobile support considered for future versions. The project’s success also depends on cloud infrastructure, third-party authentication services, and email notifications, as well as future integrations with payment gateways and bank APIs.
