# 5. Authentication and Security

**Description**:

This feature handles user authentication (e.g., login, registration) and security measures.

**Functional Requirements**:

- **FR5.1**: **User Login**
    - Users should be able to log in to their account using their email and password.
    - The system should provide an option for users to reset their password if they forget it.
- **FR5.2**: **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
    - The system should support MFA for added security, requiring users to verify their identity through an additional method (e.g., SMS code, authenticator app).
- **FR5.3**: **Session Management**
    - The system should automatically log out users after a period of inactivity (e.g., 15 minutes).
    - Users should be notified of any suspicious login attempts or changes to their account.
