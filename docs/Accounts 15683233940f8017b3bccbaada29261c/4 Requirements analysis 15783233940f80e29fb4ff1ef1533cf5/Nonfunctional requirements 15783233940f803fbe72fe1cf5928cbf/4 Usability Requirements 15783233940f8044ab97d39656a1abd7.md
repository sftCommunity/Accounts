Usability requirements define how easy and intuitive the system is for users.

- **NFR4.2**: **Mobile Responsiveness**
    - The system must provide a mobile-responsive interface, ensuring a seamless user experience across various screen sizes (smartphones, tablets, desktops).
- **NFR4.3**: **Accessibility**
    - The system should comply with **WCAG 2.1 AA** accessibility standards to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities (e.g., color contrast, text-to-speech, keyboard navigation).

    - New users should be provided with an onboarding tutorial on how to create an account, add payments, and track bills. In-app help should be available for common questions and issues.
