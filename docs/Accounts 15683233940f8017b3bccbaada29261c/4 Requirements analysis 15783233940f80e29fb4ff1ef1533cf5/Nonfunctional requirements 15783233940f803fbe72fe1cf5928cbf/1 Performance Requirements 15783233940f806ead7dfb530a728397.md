# 1. Performance Requirements

**Description**:

Performance requirements define how well the system should perform under specific conditions.

- **NFR1.1**: **System Response Time**
    - The system should provide a response to user actions (e.g., loading an account balance, viewing payment history) within **2 seconds** under normal load conditions.
    - For financial transactions (payments, bill entries), the system should process and confirm within **5 seconds**.
- **NFR1.2**: **Concurrent Users**
    - The system should support up to **1,000 concurrent users** without significant degradation in performance.
    - During peak times (e.g., billing cycles), the system should be able to handle **3,000 concurrent users** without failures.
- **NFR1.3**: **Transaction Processing Time**
    - Payment transactions and debt management operations should be processed in less than **5 seconds** from initiation to completion, ensuring smooth operation without delays.
