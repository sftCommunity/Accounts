# 8. Localization Requirements

**Description**:

Localization requirements ensure the system can support multiple languages and regions.

    - The system should support multiple languages, including English and Spanish, with the ability to easily add more languages in the future.
- **NFR8.2**: **Currency Formatting**
    - The system should display all financial data, such as payments, balances, and debts, according to the local currency format based on the user’s region (e.g., $1,000.00 for USD or €1.000,00 for EUR).
