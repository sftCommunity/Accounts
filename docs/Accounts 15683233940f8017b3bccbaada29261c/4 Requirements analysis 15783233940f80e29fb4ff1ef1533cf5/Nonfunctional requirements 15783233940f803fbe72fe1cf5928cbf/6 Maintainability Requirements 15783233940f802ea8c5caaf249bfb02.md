# 6. Maintainability Requirements

**Description**:

Maintainability requirements focus on the systemâ€™s ability to be updated and managed effectively.

- **NFR6.1**: **Modular Architecture**
    - The system should be built with a modular architecture, allowing independent updates and maintenance for different components (e.g., account management, payment processing, notifications).
- **NFR6.2**: **Error Reporting and Logging**
    - The system must provide real-time error reporting and logging, with detailed information on the error's source. Logs should be stored securely and accessible for troubleshooting.
- **NFR6.3**: **Documentation**
    - The system must have comprehensive, up-to-date documentation for both users (e.g., guides, FAQs) and developers (e.g., API documentation, system architecture).
