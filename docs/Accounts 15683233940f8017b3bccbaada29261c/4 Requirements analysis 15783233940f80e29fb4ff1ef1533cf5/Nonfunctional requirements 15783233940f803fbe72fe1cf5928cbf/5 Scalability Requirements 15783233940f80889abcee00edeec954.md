# 5. Scalability Requirements

**Description**:

Scalability requirements ensure the system can handle growth, both in terms of user base and data volume.

- **NFR5.1**: **Horizontal Scalability**
    - The system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing traffic and data, without impacting performance or reliability. This includes adding more servers or services as needed.
- **NFR5.2**: **Database Scalability**
    - The database should be able to handle increased transactions and user data. The system should support horizontal sharding, partitioning, or replication strategies to ensure it can scale efficiently.
- **NFR5.3**: **Data Archiving**
    - The system should be able to archive older transactions and data to prevent performance degradation. Archived data should be accessible upon request, but not impact the performance of the live system.
