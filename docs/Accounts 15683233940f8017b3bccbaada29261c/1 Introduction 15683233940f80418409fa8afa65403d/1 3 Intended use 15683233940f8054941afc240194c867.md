- **User interaction flow**
    - **Account Management**:
        
        Users will log into the platform to add, view, update, or remove financial accounts (e.g., bank accounts, credit cards, digital wallets).
        
        Example: *Adding a credit card account with its current balance to track its usage.*
        
    - **Payment Logging**:
        
        Users will record payments made from their accounts, categorize them (e.g., rent, groceries), and associate them with specific accounts.
        
        Example: *Logging a $500 rent payment made via a bank transfer.*
        
    - **Debt and Bill Tracking**:
        
        Users will add debts (e.g., student loans, credit card dues) or recurring bills (e.g., utilities, subscriptions) and monitor their status and due dates.
        
        Example: *Setting up a recurring electricity bill due on the 15th of each month.*
        
    - **Dashboard Insights**:
        
        Users will view a summarized dashboard showing total balances, expenses, debts, and upcoming bills.
        
        Example: *Seeing a pie chart of monthly expenses categorized into rent, groceries, subscriptions, and other expenses.*
