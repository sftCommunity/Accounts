# 1. Introduction

Managing personal finances is a crucial yet often overwhelming task in today’s fast-paced world. From juggling multiple accounts and tracking payments to staying on top of bills and debts, many individuals struggle to maintain clarity and control over their financial lives. This challenge is compounded by the lack of centralized tools that provide a clear, comprehensive, and user-friendly solution for financial management.

The **Accounts** project aims to bridge this gap by delivering a streamlined platform where users can consolidate all their financial information in one place. Designed with simplicity and effectiveness in mind, the platform allows users to manage accounts, track payments, monitor debts, and view upcoming bills effortlessly.

By prioritizing an intuitive user interface and actionable insights, **Accounts** empowers users to make informed decisions about their finances, ultimately promoting better financial habits and peace of mind. The project’s MVP will focus on core functionalities, ensuring rapid delivery of value to users while laying the foundation for future enhancements like automated bank syncing, advanced analytics, and collaborative financial tools.

This document outlines the development plan for the **Accounts** project, detailing its purpose, scope, requirements, and implementation approach, leveraging the **Waterfall Model** to ensure a structured and methodical process.
