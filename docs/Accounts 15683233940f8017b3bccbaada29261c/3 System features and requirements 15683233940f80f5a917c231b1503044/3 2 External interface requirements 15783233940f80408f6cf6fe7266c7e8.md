# 3.2 External interface requirements

External interface requirements define how the system interacts with other systems, hardware, and users. These interfaces are crucial for integration, communication, and ensuring the system works in a broader environment.

### **1. User Interfaces (UI)**

**Overview**:

The system will offer a user-friendly interface for both web and mobile platforms, enabling users to manage their accounts, payments, bills, and debts efficiently.

- **UI1.1**: **Login/Registration**:
    - The user interface must allow users to log in and register securely using their email and password.
    - Users should see a clear, accessible form for input and error messages for invalid data (e.g., incorrect password or email format).
- **UI1.2**: **Dashboard**:
    - The main dashboard should display a summary of the user’s accounts, total balance, recent payments, debts, and upcoming bills.
    - It must be easy to navigate between different sections, such as adding new accounts, viewing transaction history, and setting up reminders.
- **UI1.3**: **Account Management**:
    - Users should have clear options to add, edit, and delete accounts. Each account should be presented with basic details such as account type, balance, and payment history.
- **UI1.4**: **Payment and Debt Management**:
    - The system must allow users to easily add new payments, categorize them, and associate them with an account.
    - The debt and bill management interface should allow users to input, track, and mark debts or bills as paid.
- **UI1.5**: **Notifications**:
    - Users should be able to configure notification preferences (e.g., setting up reminders for upcoming bills, opting for email or in-app notifications).
    - Notifications should be clear, easy to read, and actionable (e.g., dismiss or snooze).

### **2. Hardware Interfaces**

**Overview**:

The application will be accessed via desktop and mobile devices. The hardware interfaces ensure the software is compatible with a variety of platforms.

- **HI1.1**: **Mobile Devices (Smartphones/Tablets)**:
    - The system must be compatible with both Android and iOS devices, providing responsive designs optimized for small screens.
    - The mobile app should interact with the user’s device for sending push notifications about upcoming bills or payments.
- **HI1.2**: **Desktops and Laptops**:
    - The web application should be optimized for use on desktops and laptops with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
    - It should have full functionality on these devices with easy navigation using a mouse and keyboard.

### **3. Software Interfaces**

**Overview**:

The system will integrate with third-party services to enhance functionality and performance.

- **SI1.1**: **Email Service Provider (e.g., SendGrid, Amazon SES)**:
    - For sending notifications and reminders, the system must integrate with an email service provider (ESP). This will be used to send reminder emails to users for due payments, debts, and bills.
    - The system must allow customization of the email template (e.g., formatting, dynamic content).
- **SI1.2**: **Payment Gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)**:
    - If the system allows users to make payments directly through the app, it must integrate with a payment gateway such as Stripe or PayPal to process transactions securely.
    - This integration should ensure that payment details are securely transmitted and stored using encryption.
- **SI1.3**: **Authentication Services (e.g., OAuth, Firebase Authentication)**:
    - The system must support OAuth or Firebase Authentication for seamless integration of third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) if users choose to log in using these services.
    - This interface should support secure token-based authentication, ensuring privacy and data security.

### **4. Communication Interfaces**

**Overview**:

This system will communicate with users and other external systems via specific protocols and channels.

- **CI1.1**: **HTTP/HTTPS (for Web)**:
    - The system will communicate over HTTP/HTTPS for secure data transmission between the client (browser or app) and the server. All communications should be encrypted using HTTPS to ensure data privacy.
- **CI1.2**: **Push Notifications (for Mobile)**:
    - The mobile app will communicate with push notification services (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging) to send reminders and alerts for bill due dates, debt payments, etc.
    - The push notifications should be timely and can include interactive elements like "Mark as Paid" or "View Details."
- **CI1.3**: **RESTful APIs**:
    - The backend should expose RESTful APIs for interaction between the frontend (mobile app and web app) and the backend system.
    - The APIs should handle all interactions related to accounts, payments, bills, notifications, and user management.

### **5. Data Interfaces**

**Overview**:

The system will interface with a database to store, retrieve, and manage user data securely.

- **DI1.1**: **Database (PostgreSQL or MySQL)**:
    - The system will store all user-related data (e.g., account details, payment history, bills, debts) in a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
    - The database will support efficient querying and indexing for handling large volumes of data (e.g., user transactions, payment history).
- **DI1.2**: **Backup Services**:
    - The system must interface with a backup service (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) to securely back up user data regularly.
    - The backup system should ensure data recovery in case of failure or corruption, maintaining integrity across multiple data points.

### **6. Security Interfaces**

**Overview**:

The system will implement security features to ensure that user data is protected, and only authorized users can access sensitive information.

- **SI1.1**: **SSL/TLS Encryption**:
    - The system must use SSL/TLS protocols to secure communication between users and the server. This ensures that all sensitive information, including login credentials and payment data, is encrypted in transit.
- **SI1.2**: **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**:
    - The system should support MFA for additional security when logging in, using an external service like Google Authenticator or SMS-based verification.
- **SI1.3**: **OAuth 2.0**:
    - The system should support OAuth 2.0 for secure, token-based access when integrating with third-party services like Google, Facebook, or other authentication providers.
